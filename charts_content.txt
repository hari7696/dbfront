Atmosphere Temperature VS Surface Temperature

-- United States
-- Y 
- 1960 2018

Takeawys

* A clear correlation between surface and atmosphere can be observed indicating that rising 
atmosphere temperatures can rise surface temperatures

* both of them shows an upward trend over the decades

* More spikes can be observed in recent years indicating the extreme weather events

Number of Countries facing extreme weather events

-- 1960 to 2018

Formula : If the the percentage of temperature change between the consecutive months is
more than 35% for atleast 4 months in a year

While there isnt a clear upward trend in the overall data,
further drilled down inspection can reveal peaks in certain geograpghic ares

CO2 Emissions vs GDP VS surface temperature
-- fix the dual axis labels
-- country United States
-- 2000 to 2020
While there was a noticeable correlation between CO2 emissions and GDP in the first decade, 
this relationship has not persisted in the recent decade, suggesting a shift toward a more e
nvironmentally conscious approach to economic growth

m23 

Carbon Intensity vs GDP

-- country Germany
--2000 to 2019

The chart display a derived metric called carbon intensity,
which is net co2 emission per person.
A clear shift of relation between the GDP and carbon emissions can be observed.

Count of Non Eco-Friendly Countries

-- 1980 to 2019

Formula :  If the country produces co2 more than 1.5 times of gloabl avegrage for the respective year,
the country is counted as non Eco friendly

The rise and slight decline of non-eco friendly countries can be observed in chart
